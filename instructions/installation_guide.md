## Getting Started with QuantymDotDesigner

### 1. Clone the Repository

To clone the repository to your local machine, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valentinjohn/quantum-dot-designer.git
```

### 2. Set Up a New Conda Environment

To ensure that you have all the required dependencies and to avoid any conflicts, it's a good idea to set up a new Conda environment specifically for this project.

First, make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.

Create a new Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name env_qdd python=3.10
```

Activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate env_qdd
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Ready to Go!

You're all set! Now you can start working on the project within your newly created Conda environment.
